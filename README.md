üîé Project Summary

This repository documents my hands-on investigation of the Introduction to Phishing scenario on the TryHackMe SOC Simulator. The challenge simulates real-world phishing incidents where a SOC Analyst must detect, triage, analyze, and respond to phishing-related alerts. The deliverable includes a comprehensive PDF report with step-by-step solutions, screenshots, findings, and recommended mitigations.
